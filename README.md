# Breast-Cancer-Classification
Applied three different Machine Learning algorithms on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnosis dataset from UCI archives.

Dataset Description -

The project is based on Wisconsin Diagnosis Breast Cancer data set. The data set has been
obtained from the ‘UCI ML’ repository, it has 569 instances and 32 attributes and there are no
missing values. The output variable is either benign (357 observations) or malignant (212
observations). The most influential variables are diagnosis, clump_thickness, uniform_cell_size
uniform_cell_shape, marginal_adhesion etc. The positive class is used to for benign cases and
the negative class is used in malignant cases. The k-fold cross-validation is utilised in which the
presented data is divided into k equally sized bits.

Solution Stages -

● Importing all the libraries and the dataset
● Feature Extraction
● Pre-processing
● Splitting the data into training and test data.
● Applying Machine Learning models
● Calculating performance metrics

For Classification we have used three machine learning models:

1. Random Forest Classifier
2. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
3. K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)

Code Implementation -

We have implemented the project using Python programming language. For machine learning
algorithms we have used Scikit Learn library of Python and coding environment used is Jupyter.
The output is shown in the BCD.ipynb file uploaded along with this document which can be
opened using any text editor like VSCode.
